C Steer file for DVCS at MeRHIC energy
C Fourth "tuned" set, basically back to wide open - see how many errors there are with Q2 back down to 1...
C Same as third "tuned" set but I changed the E-gamma energy upper limit in the code (= beam E, not beam E - 5)
C I moved Q2 max to only 40 as there never seem to be any large Q2 events (sqrt(s) = 40 for 4x100)
C Some errors, but not many - only a couple during event generation for 10k events - this should be ok
C I want the Q2 to go to the minimum to get as much angular coverage as possible
